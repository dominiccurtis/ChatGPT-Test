                    <p style=""><strong>General Product/Project Information: </strong>FundFlow is a financial application designed to provide efficient tracking, management, and reporting of funds for businesses and individuals. It is built on a scalable and secure architecture, ensuring data privacy and protection. FundFlow is easy to use and has customizable features that cater to the unique needs of each user.</p><p style=""><strong>System Architecture (Interfaces/Stack): </strong>FundFlow is built using a multi-tier architecture, with the front-end built using modern web technologies such as React, Angular, or Vue. The back-end is built using a microservices architecture using Node.js and is deployed on Kubernetes clusters on the cloud.</p><p style=""><strong>Software Architecture (interfaces/stack):</strong> FundFlow uses REST APIs to communicate between the front-end and back-end. The APIs are secured using OAuth 2.0 authentication and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authorization. The database used is PostgreSQL, which provides scalability, performance, and security.</p><p style=""><strong>Coding Conventions: </strong>FundFlow follows the industry-standard coding conventions, including naming conventions, indentation, and comments. We use a linting tool to ensure that all code follows the same conventions, and the code is peer-reviewed before being merged into the main branch.</p><p style=""><strong>Software Development Process:</strong> FundFlow follows the agile software development process, with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. We use Jira for project management, GitHub for code management, and Jenkins for the build and deployment process.</p><p style=""><strong>Pipeline Tooling:</strong> We use Jenkins for our CI/CD pipelines, which includes code linting, unit testing, integration testing, and deployment.</p><p style=""><strong>Build Process: </strong>The build process involves compiling the code, running unit tests, creating Docker images, and deploying the code to the Kubernetes clusters.</p><p style=""><strong>Installation Process: </strong>FundFlow can be installed using Docker containers, which can be easily deployed on any platform. The installation process is well-documented and includes step-by-step instructions.</p><p style=""><strong>Testing Process: </strong>FundFlow uses automated unit testing and integration testing to ensure that the code is working as expected. We also perform manual testing to cover edge cases and ensure the user experience is optimal.</p><p style=""><strong>API Descriptions: </strong>FundFlow APIs are well-documented, and we provide a detailed API reference with examples. We also provide SDKs for popular programming languages to simplify the integration process.</p><p style=""><strong>Cloud Exit Plan: </strong>FundFlow is designed to be cloud-agnostic, and we provide detailed instructions on how to migrate to a different cloud provider or on-premises infrastructure.</p><p style=""><strong>Product Skill Matrix: </strong>Our team members have expertise in front-end development, back-end development, database management, and cloud infrastructure management. We also have a dedicated quality assurance team to ensure that the product meets the highest quality standards.</p><p style=""><strong>Onboarding Process for New Team Members: </strong>New team members are provided with a detailed onboarding plan, which includes documentation, code samples, and pair programming sessions. We also encourage new team members to participate in code reviews and contribute to open-source projects.</p><p style=""><strong>Decision Criteria for Tool Stack:</strong> We evaluate our tool stack based on performance, security, maintainability, and cost. We also take into consideration the popularity and support of the tool within the developer community. We regularly review our tool stack and make changes based on feedback from our team members and customers.</p>
