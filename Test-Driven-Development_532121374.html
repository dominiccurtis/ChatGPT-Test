Add a testThe adding of a new feature begins by writing a test that passes iff the feature's specifications are met. The developer can discover these specifications by asking about use cases and user stories. A key benefit of test-driven development is that it makes the developer focus on requirements before writing code. This is in contrast with the usual practice, where unit tests are only written after code.2. Run all tests. The new test should fail for expected reasonsThis shows that new code is actually needed for the desired feature. It validates that the test harness is working correctly. It rules out the possibility that the new test is flawed and will always pass.3. Write the simplest code that passes the new testInelegant or hard code is acceptable, as long as it passes the test. The code will be honed anyway in Step 5. No code should be added beyond the tested functionality.4. All tests should now passIf any fail, the new code must be revised until they pass. This ensures the new code meets the test requirements and does not break existing features.5. Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor to ensure that functionality is preservedCode is refactored for readability and maintainability. In particular, hard-coded test data should be removed. Running the test suite after each refactor helps ensure that no existing functionality is broken.Examples of refactoring:moving code to where it most logically belongsremoving duplicate codemaking names self-documentingsplitting methods into smaller piecesre-arranging inheritance hierarchies</p><p>RepeatThe cycle above is repeated for each new piece of functionality. Tests should be small and incremental, and commits made often. That way, if new code fails some tests, the programmer can simply undo or revert rather than debug excessively. When using external libraries, it is important not to write tests that are so small as to effectively test merely the library itself,[4] unless there is some reason to believe that the library is buggy or not feature-rich enough to serve all the needs of the software under development.</p><h2 style="" id="TestDrivenDevelopment-Developmentstyle[edit]"><span class="mw-headline">Development style</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket" style="color: rgb(84,89,93);">[</span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Test-driven_development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Edit section: Development style">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket" style="color: rgb(84,89,93);">]</span></span></h2><p style="">There are various aspects to using test-driven development, for example the principles of &quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot; (<a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="KISS principle">KISS</a>) and &quot;<a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="You aren't gonna need it">You aren't gonna need it</a>&quot; (YAGNI). By focusing on writing only the code necessary to pass tests, designs can often be cleaner and clearer than is achieved by other methods.<sup class="reference"><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#cite_note-Beck-2" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;">[2]</a></sup><span> </span>In<span> </span><em>Test-Driven Development by Example</em>, Kent Beck also suggests the principle &quot;<a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_it_till_you_make_it" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Fake it till you make it">Fake it till you make it</a>&quot;.</p><p style="">To achieve some advanced design concept such as a<span> </span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Design pattern">design pattern</a>, tests are written that generate that design. The code may remain simpler than the target pattern, but still pass all required tests. This can be unsettling at first but it allows the developer to focus only on what is important.</p><p style="">Writing the tests first: The tests should be written before the functionality that is to be tested. This has been claimed to have many benefits. It helps ensure that the application is written for testability, as the developers must consider how to test the application from the outset rather than adding it later. It also ensures that tests for every feature gets written. Additionally, writing the tests first leads to a deeper and earlier understanding of the product requirements, ensures the effectiveness of the test code, and maintains a continual focus on<span> </span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Software quality">software quality</a>.<sup class="reference"><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#cite_note-Pathfinder_Solutions-6" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;">[6]</a></sup><span> </span>When writing feature-first code, there is a tendency by developers and organizations to push the developer on to the next feature, even neglecting testing entirely. The first TDD test might not even compile at first, because the classes and methods it requires may not yet exist. Nevertheless, that first test functions as the beginning of an executable specification.<sup class="reference"><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#cite_note-7" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;">[7]</a></sup></p><p style="">Each test case fails initially: This ensures that the test really works and can catch an error. Once this is shown, the underlying functionality can be implemented. This has led to the &quot;test-driven development mantra&quot;, which is &quot;red/green/refactor&quot;, where red means<span> </span><em>fail</em><span> </span>and green means<span> </span><em>pass</em>. Test-driven development constantly repeats the steps of adding test cases that fail, passing them, and refactoring. Receiving the expected test results at each stage reinforces the developer's mental model of the code, boosts confidence and increases productivity.</p><h3 style="" id="TestDrivenDevelopment-Keeptheunitsmall[edit]"><span class="mw-headline">Keep the unit small</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket" style="color: rgb(84,89,93);">[</span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Test-driven_development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Edit section: Keep the unit small">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket" style="color: rgb(84,89,93);">]</span></span></h3><p style="">For TDD, a unit is most commonly defined as a class, or a group of related functions often called a module.

These results may include explicit outputs captured during execution or state changes in the UUT.</li><li>Cleanup: Restore the UUT or the overall test system to the pre-test state. This restoration permits another test to execute immediately after this one. In some cases, in order to preserve the information for possible test failure analysis, the cleanup should be starting the test just before the test's setup run.<span> </span><sup class="reference"><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#cite_note-Pathfinder_Solutions-6" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;">[6]</a></sup></li></ul><h3 style="" id="TestDrivenDevelopment-Individualbestpractices[edit]"><span class="mw-headline">Individual best practices</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket" style="color: rgb(84,89,93);">[</span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Test-driven_development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Edit section: Individual best practices">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket" style="color: rgb(84,89,93);">]</span></span></h3><p style="">Some best practices that an individual could follow would be to separate common set-up and tear-down logic into test support services utilized by the appropriate test cases, to keep each<span> </span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_oracle" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Test oracle">test oracle</a><span> </span>focused on only the results necessary to validate its test, and to design time-related tests to allow tolerance for execution in non-real time operating systems. The common practice of allowing a 5-10 percent margin for late execution reduces the potential number of false negatives in test execution. It is also suggested to treat test code with the same respect as production code. Test code must work correctly for both positive and negative cases, last a long time, and be readable and maintainable.

So, the programmer is concerned with the interface before the implementation. This benefit is complementary to<span> </span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Design by contract">design by contract</a><span> </span>as it approaches code through test cases rather than through mathematical assertions or preconceptions.</p><p style="">Test-driven development offers the ability to take small steps when required. It allows a programmer to focus on the task at hand as the first goal is to make the test pass. Exceptional cases and error handling are not considered initially, and tests to create these extraneous circumstances are implemented separately. Test-driven development ensures in this way that all written code is covered by at least one test. This gives the programming team, and subsequent users, a greater level of confidence in the code.</p><p style="">While it is true that more code is required with TDD than without TDD because of the unit test code, the total code implementation time could be shorter based on a model by Müller and Padberg.<sup class="reference"><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#cite_note-14" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;">[14]</a></sup><span> </span>Large numbers of tests help to limit the number of defects in the code. The early and frequent nature of the testing helps to catch defects early in the development cycle, preventing them from becoming endemic and expensive problems. Eliminating defects early in the process usually avoids lengthy and tedious debugging later in the project.</p><p style="">TDD can lead to more modularized, flexible, and extensible code. This effect often comes about because the methodology requires that the developers think of the software in terms of small units that can be written and tested independently and integrated together later. This leads to smaller, more focused classes, looser<span> </span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Coupling (computer programming)">coupling</a>, and cleaner interfaces.

For example, for a TDD developer to add an<span> </span><code>else</code><span> </span>branch to an existing<span> </span><code>if</code><span> </span>statement, the developer would first have to write a failing test case that motivates the branch. As a result, the automated tests resulting from TDD tend to be very thorough: they detect any unexpected changes in the code's behaviour.

There are two times at which test doubles can be introduced into a system: link and execution. Link time substitution is when the test double is compiled into the load module, which is executed to validate testing. This approach is typically used when running in an environment other than the target environment that requires doubles for the hardware level code for compilation. The alternative to linker substitution is run-time substitution in which the real functionality is replaced during the execution of a test case. This substitution is typically done through the reassignment of known function pointers or object replacement.</p><p style="">Test doubles are of a number of different types and varying complexities:</p><ul style=""><li><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_code" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Dummy code">Dummy</a><span> </span>– A dummy is the simplest form of a test double.

A simulator typically requires significant additional development effort.<sup class="reference"><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#cite_note-Pathfinder_Solutions-6" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;">[6]</a></sup></li></ul><p style="">A corollary of such dependency injection is that the actual database or other external-access code is never tested by the TDD process itself. To avoid errors that may arise from this, other tests are needed that instantiate the test-driven code with the &quot;real&quot; implementations of the interfaces discussed above. These are<span> </span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Integration testing">integration tests</a><span> </span>and are quite separate from the TDD unit tests.

A key subset of these requirements includes support for the complete and effective testing of the system.

The Scenario Model provides an excellent vehicle for creating the strategy of interactions between components in response to a specific stimulus. Each of these Scenario Models serves as a rich set of requirements for the services or functions that a component must provide, and it also dictates the order in which these components and services interact together. Scenario modeling can greatly facilitate the construction of TDD tests for a complex system.<sup class="reference"><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development#cite_note-Pathfinder_Solutions-6" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;">[6]</a></sup></p><h3 style="" id="TestDrivenDevelopment-Managingtestsforlargeteams[edit]"><span class="mw-headline">Managing tests for large teams</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket" style="color: rgb(84,89,93);">[</span><a class="external-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Test-driven_development&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: none;" title="Edit section: Managing tests for large teams">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket" style="color: rgb(84,89,93);">]</span></span></h3><p style="">In a larger system, the impact of poor component quality is magnified by the complexity of interactions. This magnification makes the benefits of TDD accrue even faster in the context of larger projects.
